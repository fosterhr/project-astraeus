# Project Astraeus
A WIP Star Citizen flight deck.

The goal of this project is to create an immersive Star Citizen simulator, with a cockpit and 3 MFD interfaces to control ships, instruments, and social interations in the game. Feel free to follow along with this project, or contribute wherever necessary.
