# Project Astraeus
A WIP Star Citizen flight deck.

The goal of this project is to create an immersive Star Citizen simulator, with a cockpit and 3 MFD interfaces to control ships, instruments, and social interations in the game. Feel free to follow along with this project, or contribute wherever necessary.

This project will be following along with [this guide](http://www.bogdanberg.com/2020/02/08/diy-motion-simulator-part-1-intro-photos-shopping-list/) when the time comes to build a motion platform.
